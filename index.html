            <h3>Assignment 1</h3>
            <ul class ="proj">
                <li>For this assignment, we need to create a poster based on an industrial talk that we attended. The industrial discussion was hosted by UTM with the help of Clarity Techworks. This industry talk discusses about IT jobs that are currently available to people pursuing computer science degrees.

Because of the speed at which technology is developing, the speaker mostly focused on the value of adaptation in the IT industry. They discussed a few IT jobs, including data analysis, software development, and user interface design.

I learned a lot about the difficulties of pursuing an IT job from this presentation.It requires me to keep up with changes in the field and improve my skills in problem-solving.

In general, the industrial talk changes me in many ways. They provide me as a viewer with information about opportunities in the computer science sector and expose me to the world of IT careers.</li>
